        <p>My name is Derek Burton. I am a graduate of Northern Kentucky University, with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I graduated in December of 2014, and am pursuing a career into development, either through Software Engineering or through Web development.  </p>

<p>I have experience with many programming languages, but my favorite is still the language of Java. I have done some web development as well, using PHP and Ruby on Rails, along with experience in C++ and some database experience as well.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out my web site.</p>
