I will be graduating in December of 2014, and then will be pursuing a career into development, either through Software Engineering or through Web development.  \r\n\r\nI have experimented with many programming languages, but my favorite is still the reliable (for me at least) language of Java. I have done some web development as well, using PHP and Ruby on Rails.\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out my web site.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
